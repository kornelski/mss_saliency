# Maximum Symmetric Surround

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) implementation of [Maximum Symmetric Surround algorithm](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ivrl/research/saliency/saliency-msss/) by Radhakrishna Achanta.

It's a simple and fast algorithm that aims to detect "interesting" areas in the image that stand out from the background.

The implementation is only a single function that takes a 1-channel image and outputs a saliency map.

## Installation

It's a [Cargo crate](https://crates.io/crates/mss_saliency):

```sh
cargo add mss_saliency
```

## Usage

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/mss_saliency).
